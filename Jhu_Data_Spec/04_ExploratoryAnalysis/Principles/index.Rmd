## Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 1: Show comparisons

  - Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing
    hypothesis.

  - Always ask "Compared to What?"

---

## Show Comparisons

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6.5}
setwd("~/projects/PREACH")
source("regmodel.R")
with(subset(dd, group == 1), boxplot(diffsymfree, xaxt = "n", ylab = "Change in symptom-free days"))
axis(1, 1, "Air Cleaner")
abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 1.5)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6.5}
setwd("~/projects/PREACH")
source("regmodel.R")
boxplot(diffsymfree ~ group, dd, xaxt = "n", ylab = "Change in symptom-free days")
axis(1, 1:2, c("Control", "Air Cleaner"))
abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 1.5)

## Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 1: Show comparisons

  - Evidence for a hypothesis is always *relative* to another competing
    hypothesis.

  - Always ask "Compared to What?"

* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure 
  - What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

---

## Show causality, mechanism

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6.5}
setwd("~/projects/PREACH")
source("regmodel.R")
boxplot(diffsymfree ~ group, dd, xaxt = "n", ylab = "Change in symptom-free days", main = "Symptom-free Days")
axis(1, 1:2, c("Control", "Air Cleaner"))
abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 1.5)
```

Reference: Butz AM, *et al.*, *JAMA Pediatrics*, 2011.

## Show causality, mechanism

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.width = 12, fig.height=6.5}
setwd("~/projects/PREACH")
source("regmodel.R")
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
ddm$group <- factor(ddm$group, labels = c("Control", "Air Cleaner"))
boxplot(diffsymfree ~ group, ddm, ylab = "Change in symptom-free days", main = "Symptom-free Days")
abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 1.5)
boxplot(diffpm25 ~ group, ddm, ylab = expression("Change in " * PM[2.5]), main = "Fine Particulate Matter")
abline(h = 0, lty = 3, lwd = 1.5)
```

* Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure 
  - What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

* Principle 3: Show multivariate data
  - Multivariate = more than 2 variables 
  - The real world is multivariate
  - Need to "escape flatland"

---

## Show Multivariate Data

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.height=6,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
setwd("~/projects/nmmaps1987_2005")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tsModel))
d <- readRDS("ny.rds")
d <- subset(d, date < as.Date("2001-01-01"))
dout <- d[, c("date", "death")]
dout <- aggregate(d[, "death", drop = FALSE], list(d[, "date"]), sum)
names(dout)[1] <- "date"
pm <- unique(d[, c("pm10tmean", "date")])
pm$pm10 <- with(pm, Lag(pm10tmean, 1))
m <- merge(dout, pm, by = "date")

library(ggplot2)
qplot(pm10, death, data = m, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm", xlab = expression(PM[10] * " concentration (centered)"), ylab = "Daily mortality (all cuases)")
```

pm <- unique(d[, c("pm10tmean", "date")])
pm$pm10 <- with(pm, Lag(pm10tmean, 1))
m <- merge(dout, pm, by = "date")
m$season <- factor(quarters(m$date), labels = c("Winter", "Spring", "Summer", "Fall"))

library(ggplot2)
qplot(pm10, death, data = m, facets = . ~ season, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm", xlab = expression(PM[10] * " concentration (centered)"), ylab = "Daily mortality (all cuases)")

## Principles of Analytic Graphics

* Principle 4: Integration of evidence
  - Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams

  - Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation 

  - Don't let the tool drive the analysis

  - Don't let the tool drive the analysis

* Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate
  labels, scales, sources, etc.

  - A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

* Principle 6: Content is king

  - Analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the
    quality, relevance, and integrity of their content
