## Install Git

* Unless you really know what you are doing, just go with the default options at each step of the installation

* Once the install is complete, hit the "Finish" button (you may want to uncheck the box next to "Review ReleaseNotes.rtf")

## Open Git Bash

* Find a program called Git Bash, which is the command line environment for interacting with Git
* It should be located in the Git directory within your Start Menu (or in the directory into which Git was installed)

## Open Git Bash

* Once Git Bash opens, you'll see a short welcome message followed by the name of your computer and a dollar sign on the next line
* The dollar sign means that it's your turn to type a command

## Configure Username and Email

* Each commit to a Git repository will be "tagged" with the username of the person who made the commit
* Enter the following commands in Git Bash, one at a time, to set your username and email:

```
$ git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
$ git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
```

* Make sure there are 2 dashes side-by-side before the word "global"
* You'll only have to do this once, but you can always change these down the road using the same commands

---

## Configure Username and Email

* Now type the following to confirm your changes (they may be listed toward the bottom):

```
$ git config --list
```

* Make sure there are 2 separate dashes (side-by-side) before the word "global"

## What's Next?

* Go ahead and close Git Bash with the following command:

```
$ exit
```

* Now that Git is set up on your computer, we're ready to move on to GitHub, which is a web-based platform that lets you do some pretty cool stuff
* Once GitHub is up and running, we'll show you how to start using these tools to your benefit
